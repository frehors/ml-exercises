    "## Exercise 1: AdaBoost and VC-dimension\n",
    "In this exericse, we will investigate the VC-dimension of voting classifiers and argue that one has to be careful with the number of iterations of boosting to guarantee good generalization performance with high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will consider is one-dimensional, i.e. a single feature. Our weak learner is decision stumps, i.e. a base hypothesis $h$ can be specified by a splitting value $v$, and two leaf values $a, b \\in \\{-1,1\\}$. Given a one-dimensional feature vector $x = (x_1)$, the hypothesis $h$ returns $a$ when $x_1 \\leq v$ and it returns $b$ otherwise. We let $H$ denote the set of all such decision stumps, i.e. $H$ is the set of base hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VC-dimension of base classifier\n",
    "1. Show that the VC-dimension of $H$ is $2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Trivially the VC dimension is atleast 2. Arguing for VC dimension less than three we can use the classic line argument with the labeling (1,-1,1) which we cannot seperate with a single stump\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### VC-dimension of voting classifiers\n",
    "Let $C$ be the class of all voting classifiers over $H$, i.e. $C$ consists of all hypotheses of the form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\textrm{sign}(\\sum_{h \\in H} \\alpha_h h(x))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We will show that $C$ has infinite VC-dimension. To do so, we will argue that for any size $n$, there is a set of $n$ points $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ in 1d that can be shattered, i.e. for any labeling $y \\in \\{-1,1\\}^n$ of the $n$ points, there is a hypothesis $g$ in $C$ such that $g(x_i)=y_i$ for all $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. First argue that for any interval $[a, b]$ and value $z \\in \\{-1,1\\}$, it is possible to find decision stumps $h_1,h_2$ such that for $x \\in (a, b]$, we have $h_1(x)+h_2(x) = 2z$ and for any $x \\notin (a, b]$, we have $h_1(x) + h_2(x) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "If we create the stumps given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_1 =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    " z & x>a \\\\\n",
    " -z & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases} ,\n",
    "\\quad h_2 =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    " z & x\\leq b \\\\\n",
    "-z & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $x\\in (a,b]$ we would have that the two stumps each output $z$. $x<a$ we would have $h_1(x) = -1$ and $h_2(x) = 1$ and thus the sum would cancel out, same argument for $x>b$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use what you showed in 2. to come up with a 1d data set of size $n$ that you can shatter, i.e. generate any possible dichotomy/labeling using a voting classifier from $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the $n$ points we would be able to create an interval, which only includes the singleton that is the point. Thus for point $x_i$ for $i=1, 2, \\ldots , n$ we would be able to construct the following two decision stumps\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_1^{(i)} =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    " z & x\\geq x_i \\\\\n",
    " -z & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases} ,\n",
    "\\quad h_2^{(i)} =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    " z & x\\leq x_i \\\\\n",
    "-z & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup would be able to label the point $x_i$ while having no influence on the labeling of other points, since they cancel out. Thus we can shatter any number of points and therefore the vc dim is $\\infty$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Growth function for few base learners\n",
    "Finally, consider if we restrict ourselves to only using voting classifiers that combine the predictions of no more than $T$ base hypotheses. To simplify the exercise, we will even assume that we use precisely the coefficients $\\alpha_h=1$ for the $T$ hypotheses. That is, we consider the set of voting classifiers $C^T$ containing all hypotheses of the form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\textrm{sign}(\\sum_{i=1}^T h_i(x))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $h_1,\\dots,h_T$ are hypotheses from $H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we have generalization bounds in terms of the growth function $m_H(n)$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pr[|E_{out}(h^*)-E_{in}(h^*)| > \\varepsilon] < 8m_H(2n)e^{-\\varepsilon^2 n/8}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the growth function $m_H(n)$ when $H$ is the set of decision stumps on 1d data?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is a good upper bound on the growth function $m_{C^T}(n)$?"
